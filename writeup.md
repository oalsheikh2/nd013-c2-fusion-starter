# Writeup: Track 3D-Objects Over Time

Please use this starter template to answer the following questions:

### 1. Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?


### 2. Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 
Absoulutely! LiDAR provides the physical properties of the environment around it, such as distance and speeds, while it aids in the detection of objects in a 3D point from camera images

### 3. Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?
I noticed that the LiDAR sometimes casts a shadow of the objects infront of it which means missing roadway features and possibly an inability to detect objects at that blind spot 

### 4. Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
